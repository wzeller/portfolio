									<p>A prototype for a non-profit to raise money for paralegal training program in Nigeria. Users upload photos, learn about paralegals, make donations, track sponsored paralegals, and create and join donation teams. Page and graphics update instantly via AJAX. Overwrote Backbone’s default model#parse method to build Rails-like associations on the client side. Custom-built modal when hovering over paralegal picture links to their personal page. Index view comprises paralegal subviews combined on page load.</p>

						<h2>About Me</h2>
						<p>tl;dr I've always been a math and computer nerd, but it took 7 years as a lawyer and numerous detours before realizing that I wanted to write code for the rest of my life.</p>
						<p>I started coding when I was about 5 and our family got its first computer.  I painstakingly copied out page after page of BASIC code from massive books, changing bits and pieces to see how it worked.  My friends and I wrote our own text-based 'choose-your-own-adventure' games modeled off Infocom classics.<br /></p>
						<p>Although a voracious reader, I always loved math -- especially logic puzzles and other brainteasers.  I also was fascinated with codes and ciphers, reading books about crytography and composing my own simple ciphers.  In high school, a particularly permissive teacher allowed me to write programs on my TI-81 during geometry class as long as the programs had mathy applications.  I wrote several programs to do such things as reduce a fraction to its lowest common denominator, find the nth prime, etc.  Surreptitiously, I wrote a very slow -- but playable -- version of Arkanoid that you could play on the calculator, a feat I remain proud of to this day!</p>
						<p>Instead of studying math or engineering in college I started off as a philosophy major and ended up studying psychology.  But I remained fascinated with computers, enigmas, and math.  I became particularly interested in chess, and watched live as Kasparov lost to Deep Blue (as predicted by Kurzweil).  I spent hours solving riddles and doing crossword puzzles and working out math problems and cognitive tests online.  I loved statistics and research methods classes, and worked as a TA with a psych grad student doing research into game theory.  To get background on the project, I read with fascination Robert Axelrod's book <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Evolution_of_Cooperation">The Evolution of Cooperation</a>, which involves a contest in which people compete to design a computer program that can win in prisoners'-dilemma style competitions (the simple tit-for-tat was typically the best strategy).  Still, I did not know what I wanted to do.  My intellectual hero was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Powers">Richard Powers</a>, a fiction author who spent several years as a programmer and wrote fascinating novels about technology and AI.</p>
						<p>After college I got a job at the Attorney General's office in Chicago in the High Tech Crimes Division.  They had me reading 2600 and also recent cyberlaw (the PATRIOT Act had just been passed) to write reports on the latest hacks as well as updates in the law.  I liked the tech and law aspects of my job.  Legal writing was (when done well) an extremely clear and rigorous form of argument -- almost like math, it seemed.  I took some practice LSATs (which were strangely enjoyable, especially the logic), did well, and decided to go to law school at Northwestern.</p>
						<p>Law school was fascinating but also frustrating -- the tests were all essays, and there were not always "right" answers.  I was so starved for rigor that I took a math class at the business school called Math Methods for Decisions.  It was great -- applied probability to decisionmaking, taught by a sometime professional poker player from MIT -- and I got the highest grade in the class.  I also brought some math/tech into two projects.  In one I outlined how you could build an AI judge using a genetic algorithm to "train" it on an area in caselaw.  Once the "judge" was trained, you could use it to decide novel cases, and study which variables turned out to be the most salient in determining decision.  In another I showed how small differences in preferences for neighbors could aggregate into housing patterns that looked highly discriminatory by using research from computer simulations (<a href="http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/Segregation">read more here</a>).  These projects were among the highlights of law school, but I still didn't understand the underlying pattern (ironically, I was enthralled with patterns except in my own life).</p>
						<p>After school I got a job as an associate attorney at Walker Wilcox Matousek LLP in Chicago, a boutique litigation and insurance coverage firm that split off from a large firm then called Lord Bissell & Brook (now Locke Lord LLP).  I was the first new hire for the fledgling firm, and it was an exciting place to work.  The next few years were a blur of long hours and frenetic learning.  The small firm afforded me the opportunity to work on important matters from the get-go, and I worked with senior partners and attorneys who shared their time and experience with me.  My writing and knowledge of the law improved quickly, and I developed a reputation for good brief writing and clear thinking.</p>  
						<p>Many of our clients insured the directors and officers for major corporations.  The main exposure for these policies were securities class action lawsuits.  These lawsuits settle for tens of millions -- sometimes even hundreds of millions -- of dollars.But the settlements themselves are strange in that the cases almost never (less than 1%) go to actual trials.  This means that the settlements are based on expert testimony and settlement models.  These models, in turn, are based on prior settlements.  Several firms have a near-monopoly on estimating the settlement value of these cases.</p>

						<p>We had several of these consultants' reports from prior cases, which I read with a lot of interest.  The reports provided some info on the assumptions and models used by the experts (who charged tens of thousands for a single report), and google led me to some of the academic papers on which they were based.  In my spare time, I made a model using Excel that generated predicted values based on historical data on stock market prices using assumptions similar to those used by the consultants.  I refined the model to take into account additional variables and compared it to prior predictions from the consultants.  The model became more and more sophisticated, and eventually started getting pretty close to the actual reports.  This was all done on my spare time, and it never occurred to me that it might be useful to clients.  Then our managing partner found out what I did and was really thrilled.  He had me give a presentation about my methodology to a major client.  We started offering the reports to clients, and I got to refine my model even further.  The work was fascinating and very different than the rest of my legal work.  I really looked forward to these assignments, and found the mixture of qualitative and quantitative work to be enthralling.  I also realized that data and models made a sort of sense to me that law rarely did.</p> 

						<p>Fast forward a few years.  I decided to move to SF.  Unexpectedly, my firm asks me to continue working for them remotely, which I do for several years.  In 2012, I took and passed the California Bar Exam.  Meanwhile, I was becoming increasingly dissatisfied practicing law.  I also started meeting people who were programmers, and loved picking their brain about problems they were working on.  It seemed much more interesting than what I was doing.  I did the python and ruby courses on Code Academy and was pretty much hooked.  Then I started working with an iOS programmer and we discussed programming during breaks between brief writing.  He encouraged me to learn ruby and rails and node.js.  In the spring of 2013, my firm asked me to submit plans to start an SF office.  It was a decision point.  Either go forward to open an office, or leave and follow my passion.</p>  

						<p>I chose the latter.  The plan was to learn Spanish, learn more coding, and get a job I love. First I moved to Chile for two months in May and June 2013 where I taught English and was immersed in Spanish for a month, surfed and explored down the coast, doubled back to San Pedro de Atacama, crossed the Andes to Bolivia and spent a week in La Paz.  The experience was amazing, and cracked my mind open to what I could learn if I stayed open and curious. When I got back I started working my way through Project Euler problems using Ruby, knowing that I needed a project to make sure I was learning concepts rather than simply the jargon.  Once I started working on these problems I realized with certainty this was what I wanted to do.  I could spend an entire day -- in total flow -- trying to construct a new solution, or optimizing one that ran slow, and the rush when I solved the problem was unreal.</p>

						<p>Around this time I learned about coding bootcamps springing up in SF.  After some research I decided to apply to <a href="http://www.appacademy.io/#p-home">App Academy</a>, a program that is highly-selective (under 5% of applicants), has a very high placement rate (over 98%), and, best of all, doesn't charge you until you get a job.  This alignment of incentives, plus good word-of-mouth, convinced me this was where I wanted to go.  I successfully made it through three coding interviews and was admitted to the March 30-June 20, 2014 session, which I'm just completing.</p>
						<p>It was such a fantastic experience: 100 hr weeks for 9 weeks and a deep dive into Ruby, Rails, SQL, JavaScript, Backbone.js, and even a day of Node.js.  My skills and understanding became so much deeper and more honed, and by the end I was able to clone the core functionality and appearance of Kiva in a little over a week, which brought home with clarity the distance I'd traveled.  (My writing on the App Academy experience is <a href="www.tumblr.com/blog/wzeller42">here.</a>)  I have no illusions that I know everything, but I'm now at a point where I feel like, if there is anything in JS or Ruby/Rails I don't know, I can figure it out in a reasonable time and understand libraries where others solved the same problem.  The coolest thing was the feeling of working for 90-100 hours on making projects and, although sometimes I'd get tired or need to stretch, never ever feeling bored.  I've worked those type of hours before as a lawyer, but it never felt like this.  This was something I want to do for the rest of my life.</p> <br>
